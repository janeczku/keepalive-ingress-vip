# Keepalived Ingress VIP

![Hero Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janeczku/keepalived-ingress-vip/master/img/banner-top.png)

This is a HA/IP failover solution for Kubernetes Ingress Controllers, such as [NGINX Ingress](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) and mainly useful for on-premises environments that lack infrastructure load balancing capabilities.

It provides a virtual IP for terminating ingress traffic on the cluster and provides sub-second failover in scenarios such as node crashing, node being drained during cluster upgrades or node becoming network partitioned from Kubernetes control plane.

The Virtual IP is managed using the [Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) implementation of Keepalived](https://keepalived.readthedocs.io/en/latest/case_study_failover.html) and - instead of relying on Kubernetes API state (which would be to slow for this purpose) - the readiness of the ingress nodes is determined by running probes against local HTTP health check endpoints (Ingress, Kubelet).

## Prerequisites

- Network infrastructure must permit the use of VRRP protocol and multicast traffic (which excludes most public clouds)
- Tested on a vSphere 6.7u3 environment with stock vSwitch and port group setup. Other non-cloud infrastructure providers should work.
- The Chart included in the repo requires Helm >= v3.1

### Installing the Chart using Rancher

In the Rancher GUI, navigate to __Cluster->System Project->Tools->Catalog__ and click on __Add Catalog__:

- Name: <Some Name>
- Catalog URL: `https://github.com/janeczku/keepalived-ingress-vip`
- Helm Version: `Helm v3`

Afterwards, you can launch the chart from the System project's __Apps__ page providing the configuration variables documented below.

### Installing the Chart using Helm CLI

To run the application using the virtual IP `172.16.135.2/21` on the host interface named `ens160`:

```bash
$ helm install -n vip keepalived-ingress-vip ./chart \
  --set keepalived.vrrpInterfaceName=ens160 \
  --set keepalived.vipInterfaceName=ens160 \
  --set keepalived.vipAddressCidr="172.16.135.2/21"
```

### Uninstalling the Chart using Helm CLI

To uninstall the `keepalived-ingress-vip` deployment:

```bash
$ helm delete -n vip keepalived-ingress-vip
```
